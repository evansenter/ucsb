Reading Reaction

Note: My writing will be in response to sections 2 and 4 - the components of a cell and the molecular structures that they are composed of.

I felt that Lawrence Hunter's introductory chapter to molecular biology was very well written - it provided an excellent high level overview of the facets of an undergraduate course in cell biology. In the second and fourth sections of the first chapter he outlines the different parts of a cell, and the compounds that are players in these organelles. I was unable to find any errors in the second section, but wished that it was a bit more detailed; the author glosses over some major cellular components, namely the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, endo/lysosomes, vaculoles, and the cytoskeleton. Despite (Or perhaps because of) the lack of information regarding these organelles, I was inspired to do some light reading on Wikipedia about cellular biology in general, and touched on these parts.

In the fourth section I found an excellent and more detailed account of biochemistry and biopolymers, touching on proteins and nucleic acids. I saw a couple terms that I had forgotten: aliphatic, meaning a straight hydrocarbon chain, the famous aromatic ring structures, and the process of allosteric control. In the section on nucleic acids I ended up reading about the phosphodiester bond through secondary sources (Again, Wikipedia).

It was a sentence at the end of the fourth section that really connected the reading to this class for me: there is more information available to a cell than appears in the sequence databases.

All in all I really enjoyed the reading, and although it was review for me, I thought it was well enough laid out that any layman having taken high school biology could walk away with an appreciation for the intricacy of the cell.
