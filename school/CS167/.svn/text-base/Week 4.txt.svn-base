[Course Outline, Week 4]

- Prepare a project webpage by Friday.
  - List the first milestone, and the progress being made towards it.
- Reading assignment due Friday.
- Review matrix multiplication, eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Before next lecture look up: Normal, Gaussian, Poisson distributions, what they look like and the mean (Alignment statistics).

[Definitions]
Parsimonious tree: A tree that minimizes the number of changes needed to draw direct correlations between collections of sequences (Similar to the diff algorithm?).
Type I Error: False positives.
Type II Error: False negatives.
Sensitivity: True positives / positives
Specificity: True negatives / negatives
ROC Curve: Receiver Operating Characteristics, graph of TP/P vs. FP/N

[Analysis of the Juke-Cantor Model]

| a, a, 1-3a, a |
| a, a, a, 1-3a |  =  Q

- Q takes an input vector x, and transforms it to an output vector y
  - For cases where Qx = \x (Where applying Q to x does not alter the direction of the vector x):
    - x is an eigenvector, \ is an eigenvalue.
    
- The eigenvectors of a symmetrical matrix (Where Q = QT [QT is the transpose of Q]) are at right-angles (orthogonal) to each other.
  - This can be verified by taking the dot product of the eigenvectors.
  
- A matrix whose eigenvectors are linearly independent can be decomposed as: A = x \ x^(-1)
  - x is an eigenvector, \ is an eigenvalue.
  - For the symmetric case, A = x \ xT
  - A^n = x \^n xT
  
- See handwritten notes for more details!

[PAM Score Matrix Construction]
- PAM: Point accepted mutations (Built from global alignments).
- One chooses n based on the expected.
- Steps:
  1. Obtain closely related sequences and align them (using a parsimonious tree).
  2. Compute f (probability of i's symbol occurrence), A (frequency of aligning i against j), M (mutability of i), estimate \
  3. Multiply M n times.
  4. Obtain score matrix.
- Larger n's in PAMn matrix imply a more distant divergence.
  
[BLOSUM Score Matrix Construction]
- BLOSUM: Block substitution matrix (Built from local alignments).
- Steps to generate matrix are in the lecture slides.
- In BLOSUMn, if two sequences are more than n% similar the sequences are weighted to sum to 1.
  - Larger numbers indicate more recent divergence (Opposite of PAM).
  
[Measuring Quality]

- Positives = True positives + False negatives (II)
- Negatives = True negatives + False positives (I)
- A random selection on an ROC curve has a line with slope 1.
- If you are going to flip a fair coin (p = 0.5) n times, the expected length R of the longest run of heads is R = log(subscript: 1/p)(n)
  - To model random sequence alignments, replace a match with "heads" and a mismatch with "tails".
    - For DNA, the match p = 1/4, for proteins p = 1/20
  - This model breaks down when attempting to apply this to a score matrix.
