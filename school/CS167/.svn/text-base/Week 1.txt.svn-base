[Principal Datasets and Background Information]

1) DNA / Protein sequences (DNA => RNA => Protein)
  - DNA can code for more than one protein sequence
    - Homologous, non-homologous, alternative splicing
    - Genes can be duplicated in diferent ways
      - Gene duplication (Internal, partial or complete duplication)
      - Chromosomal duplication (Partial/complete polysomy or aneuploidy)
      - Genomic duplication (Polyploidy)
    - Mitosis / Meiosis
  - Protein sequences are made up of 20 different amino acids
2) Macromolecular Structure
  - Structure determines function
    - Ramachandran plot (Phi / Psi angles define degree of rotational freedom)
  - Primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure
    - Primary: Protein sequence (NH3 [Amine] to COOH [Carboxyl])
    - Secondary: Alpha helix / Beta sheet
    - Tertiary: 3D strcture
    - Quarternary: Arrangement of protein subunits
  - Protein folding
    - A search to find the lowest energy state of a protein in three space
    - Chaperones assist in the folding and unfolding of macromolecular structures
3) Pathways / Graphs (Functional interactions)
  - Used to predict:
    - Function of a protein based on its neighborhood
    - Missing members of a partial pathway
  - Complexity of graph theory:
    - P: Solvable on a deterministic machine in polynomial time
    - NP: Solvable on a nondeterministic machine in polynomial time
    - It is not known if the graph sub-isomorphism (similarity) problem is NP-hard or not
4) Image Data
  - Tracks the spatio-temporal location of proteins
  - Can be used to identify cellular or subcellular components
5) Microarray Data
  - Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
    - Required components:
      - DNA template to be amplified
      - Complementary primers
      - DNA polymerase (Taq polymerase)
      - Deoxynucleoside triphosphates (To build complementary strand)
    - Steps:
      - Initialization step
      - Denaturation step
      - Annealing step
      - Extension / elongation step
      - Final elongation step
      - Final hold step
6) Additional sources of data
  - Mass spectrometry
  - Gel electrophoresis
  - Crystallography data
  - Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
