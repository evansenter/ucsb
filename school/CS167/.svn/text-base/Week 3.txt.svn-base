[Definitions]

Ortholog: Two genes connected by a speciation event
Paralog: Two genes connected by a duplication event
Xenolog: To genes connected by a horizontal transfer
Homologs: Any of an ortholog, paralog or homolog
Non-degenerate site: A nucleotide within a gene that can't be changed without having repercussions to the amino acid produced
k-fold degenerate site: A nucleotide within a gene that can be converted k ways without having repercussions to the amino acid produced
TATA box: The sequence TATAAA in eukaryotes and archaea is the core promoter for transcription, and usually found 25 b.p. upstream of the translation start
Stem loop (Hairpin loop): Occurs when a (usually) palindromic region of DNA's base pairs bind together to create a double-helix ending in an unpaired loop. This is a common secondary structure for RNA. (Note that in RNA, guanine - uracil has two hydrogen bonds and is considered favorable).

Eigenvalues!

[Homologous Genes and Genetic Variations]

- There are functional and selective constraints on a gene that causes a variable rate of evolution

[Eukaryotic Gene Sequence]

- Order:
  1. 5' flanking region (Enhancers / promoters)
  2. Transcription initiation
  3. Untranslated region (5' UTR)
  4. Translation initiation (AUG, Methionine)
  5. Exons / introns
  6. Translation termination (Stop codon)
  7. Untranslated region (3' UTR)
  8. 3' flanking region
  9. Pseudogenes (Very high rate of change because they have no function)
  
[Jukes-Cantor Model]

- An application of the Markov Chain analysis to determine the distance back in time for the common ancestor of two sequences
- Observed rate of substitutions = p = (3/4)(1 - (1 - 4a)^t)
  
[Allele Frequency]

p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1, p + q = 1

[Score Matrix]

Bayes' theorem: P(A | B) = (P(B | A)P(A)) / P(B)

- Higher scores means a greater similarity
x = ACT
y = AGT
log(P(x,y | M (Related)) / P(x,y | R (Random))) = log(P(AA | M) * P(CG | M)) + log(P (TT | M) / P(AA | R)) + log(P(CG | R) * P (TT | R))

P(x, M) = P(M) * P(x | M) + ... = P(x)
