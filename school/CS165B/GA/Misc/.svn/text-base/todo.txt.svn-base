Issues:

Cell - cell collisions
	-> Sort by fitness	2
Reproduction (Mitosis)
	-> New cells should be placed near their parent rather than randomly (Incorporate into the chromosome)	1
	-> Induced mitosis at specific ages and fitness levels	2
	-> Fitness penalty for mitosis	1
	-> Balance starting fitness, etc and when they die	3
Environment layered seperately from cells	1
Gene level fitness
(1) Chromosome class					(COMPLETE)
	-> 1 chromosome for each set of genetic modifiers (cell type, interactions, ...)	1 (COMPLETE)
(2) Gene class
Cells have names that express the similarities of their chromosomes (Or some sort of id marker for like / notlike cell)	
	-> You could allow cells to broadcast a random integer that only mutates in small steps to express the evolutionary similarity of 2 cells	(1)
Cell layering	  3
Change age to a birth tick so you don't have to continually update all the cell's age each round	2
Poison food cells as well as regular ones		2

Restricted mating is another dimension being explored to allow a population to develop multiple niches.

Things that should be under the control of the chromosome
	-> Crossover frequency (Need a function that gives higher probability of a crossover occuring at a homologous region of the chromosome pairs
	-> Mutation frequency
	-> Mitosis conditions
	-> Starting fitness
	
	-> Response to surroundings
	
	-> Signalling / Receiving
