Stuff to know:
  Movies: The American Colonies
            - Colonists were incentivized to bring servants into the colonies (Virginia); given 50 acres per head.
            - Wanted to maximize the production of cash crops.
            - Debtor laws made it illegal to leave the county in which you owed money (Foreshadowing of the Black Codes).
            - Many of the slaves initially brought into the colonies were from the Caribbean, a region already ripe with slavery.
          Africans in America
            - The Terrible Transformation - This was the concept that the shift to a slave based workforce was a continuous and incremental transformation.
            - In 1691 it was made illegal for Virginia slave-owners to emancipate their slaves without paying for their transportation out of Virginia.
          Roots of Resistance
            - With all the uprisings and rebellions instigated as the practice of slavery continued, a much more strict set of laws were enforced to subdue the slaves.
            - The Underground Railroad was a self-organizing means that slaves could use to try and escape.
            - Tensions grew between the North and South, and less than 6 months after Abraham Lincoln became President the Civil War began.
              - Lincoln claimed his goal was to preserve the Union.
              - The Emancipation Proclamation declared the freedom of slaves in the Confederate States, and spurred the mass northern exodus of runaways to the North, where many joined the Union forces.

  Books:
    Let Nobody Turn Us Around (Collection of authors [Douglass, Scott, Walker])
      - Basically, it's a farce that everyone celebrates the Fourth of July, because of the irony in the nationalistic recognition of the institution of slavery.
      - Richard Allen was a slave, was sent to Philly and involved himself in the Methodist Church in some way or another.
      - A lot of the black organizations created had dual purposes; both a liberative theology and a social construct.
    
    Faces At The Bottom Of The Well (Derrick Bell)
      Racial realism: (pg. 98) 
        1. Historical perspective: There has been no linear progress in civil rights, a pattern of cyclical progression / regression.
        2. Economics: It is necessary to have less discussion of ethics and more discussion of economics (The real root of power / the problem).
          - This is how the professor is orienting this course (What position do blacks have in the economic system).
        3. Satisfaction through struggle: Calling out to a history of resistance, while they may get some rights back, there is still an issue of the continued struggle.
        4. The realization and acceptance that racism is an ongoing issue in the US, and that it doesn't disappear, it merely changes guises.
    
    Wages of Whiteness (David Roediger)
      - All of the characteristics which were not held by whites in the new capitalist discipline were projected on to the blacks.
      - Minstrel shows: A popular stage entertainment featuring songs, dances, and comic dialogue in highly conventionalized patterns, usually performed by white actors in blackface.
      - Blackface: The makeup used by a nonblack performer playing a black role. The role played is typically comedic or musical and usually is considered offensive.
      
  Key Notes:
    - There are 2 things that you can not amend to the constitution
      1. You can not change the number of representatives entitled to each state in the Senate.
      2. You can not end the slave trade prior to 1808.
      
    - Dred Scott
      - Slave who sued his master for his freedom, based on the grounds that he had been living in a free state.
      - Lost the first case, won the second, the appeal went to the Supreme Court.
        - In effect, the Court ruled that slaves had no claim to freedom; they were property and not citizens; they could not bring suit in federal court; and because slaves were private property, the federal government could not revoke a white slave owner's right to own a slave based on where he lived, thus nullifying the essence of the Missouri Compromise. Taney, speaking for the majority, also ruled that since Scott was an object of private property, he was subject to the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution which prohibits taking property from its owner "without due process".
        
    - David Walker
      - Was a free black activist living in Boston.
      - Wrote Walker's Appeal, which highlights 4 key reasons for black wretchedness:
        1) Slavery
        2) Submissiveness
        3) Indifference
        4) False help
      - Found dead outside his home less than a year after releasing his appeal.
    
    - The Reconstruction (1865-1876) Amendments
      13: Ends the slave and indentured servitude practices in the United States.
      14: Extends citizenship to all persons born in the United States (overturns Dred Scott).
          Guarantees due process and equal protection under the law (extends the Bill of Rights to the States).
      15: Black males have the rights to vote.
      
    - The Industrial Revolution:
      - At the turn of the century the United States is a rural agrarian nation, and by the turn of the century it becomes an industrial capitalistic country.
      - Ellis Island was a triage, and allowed the United States to selectively choose which of the immigrants were permitted to come into the mainland and remain in the States.
      - The one problem with taking immigrants on a mass scale was the ethnic conflicts that they brought with them.
        - Thus they created the concept of whiteness, and leveraged racism to unify all the immigrants under a common cause.
