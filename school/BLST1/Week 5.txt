Notes:
  - Interposition: States have the right to interpose itself between federal laws viewed as unjust.
  - Nullification: States have the right to nullify the illegitimacy of a federal law.
  - The Dred Scott case neutralizes the Missouri Compromise by disallowing him his rights to liberty
    - This is done to reinforce the right of citizens to own and move their property around the country
  - The slave system in the United States in the 19th century shifted from cash crops such as tobacco to cotton and indigo (textiles, from the industrial revolution).
  - The British want to end the slave trade so they can keep the labor force in Africa to mine the natural resources for their industrial revolution.
  - Wage labor is far more beneficial to society because once the workers are responsible for providing for themselves, there is no longer an advantage to the passive rebellion such as breaking tools, etc. Slave owners are responsible for financing every aspect of their slaves' lives.
  - There are two economic markets: Wall Street and the commodities market (in Chicago).
  - Jacksonian democracy is the spread of the democratic rights (previously restricted to land owners) westward to those who were populating the United States.
  
  Leading up to the Civil War:
    - Southern states are arguing from the vantage of States' Rights, claiming that they are allowed to nullify federal laws regarding the perpetuation of the slave workforce.
      - The Achilles Heel of the South was that their means of production relied entirely on slave labor.
    - Northern states argue that those terms were not in the original agreement.
      - The problem was that the South had the best generals.
      - The North won in the end because they had more technical power (through industrialization) and they had more people.
    - Modern war: Completely destroy the infrastructure of the enemy, and break down their means to produce.
    - Emancipation Proclamation: The announcement made by President Lincoln during the Civil War on September 22, 1862, emancipating all black slaves in states still engaged in rebellion against the Union. Although implementation was strictly beyond Lincoln's powers, the declaration turned the war into a crusade against slavery. It was signed on January 1, 1863.
      - This proclamation stated that any slave that attached themselves to a Union unit would no longer be returned to the Southerners.
      - The runaway slaves integrated into the Northern military, and some 200,000 fresh black soldiers joined the Northern forces.
  
  The Reconstruction (1865-1876) Amendments: 
      13: Ends the slave and indentured servitude practices in the United States.
      14: Extends citizenship to all persons born in the United States (overturns Dred Scott).
          Guarantees due process and equal protection under the law (extends the Bill of Rights to the States).
      15: Black males have the rights to vote.
  - Jim Crow laws: The segregation of black people in the United States.
    - This was done because blacks and whites were uniting within their classes, which was threatening to the ruling class.
  - Slaughterhouse cases: Changes the 14th amendment to apply solely to state law.
  
  The Industrial Revolution:
    - At the turn of the century the United States is a rural agrarian nation, and by the turn of the century it becomes an industrial capitalistic country.
    - Ellis Island was a triage, and allowed the United States to selectively choose which of the immigrants were permitted to come into the mainland and remain in the States.
    - The one problem with taking immigrants on a mass scale was the ethnic conflicts that they brought with them.
      - They created the concept of whiteness, and leveraged racism to unify all the immigrants under a common cause.
      - The immigrants had to be kept in separate living areas, hence the many quarters in east coast cities.
