World War I/II:
- Civil War was the first modern war - the war is around metropolitan areas (Destroying the production infrastructure) rather than a conflict between individual soldiers.
- Trench warfare / No Man's Land.
  - The colonizing nations brought their subjects with them to the trenches.
    - The conclusion the subjects came to is that anyone willing to participate in trench warfare for so long is not superior to any race.
