[Black Studies 1]

* There's probably going to be a lot of Constitution / Bill of Rights stuff on the midterm, as well as Dred Scott, David Walker.

Notes:
  - Review the dialectic of struggle from Week 3.
  - The ideological father of black resistance is a man named David Walker (pg. 13 of the text about him and his appeal).
    - The institution of slavery was always a legal system.
    
David Walker:
  - Makes his appeal to two different partitions of his reader base (Through pamphlets).
    - First to the Americans (The whites):
      - Tells them to look at their documents; the constitution, the bible, etc and consider the repercussions of slavery (Integrationist argument, Moses story).
    - Second appeal is to the black community:
      - Any black person who is not actively resisting the institution of slavery is a traitor to the race and should be dealt with accordingly.
  - He was found dead in his print shop, it was claimed to be an accident.
      
- Slavery is a denial of the liberty and happiness entitled to all citizens by the constitution.
- Slavery was the most fundamental institution of society in the United States. Hence the movie title: The Terrible Transformation.
- The underground railroad movement was a continuation of the resistance that slaves had been perpetuating since their enslavement.

Dred Scott: Petitioned for freedom after traveling to a free state with his master. The supreme court denied him the opportunity to attain citizenship.

Brown vs. Board of Education:

Movie - Roots of Resistance:
- Even those that didn't own slaves defended the practice.
- People believed that blacks were an inferior race to whites.
  - A series of photographs and pamphlets were published to both prove and perpetuate this belief.
- As America grew, so did the number of slaves.
- There was always a fear of being sold.
- Nat Turner (Preacher / field-hand): Behold the pale horse.
  - Rebelled with a group of armed slaves in an insurrection that lasted 36 hours.
  - Saw his mission as religious, and bigger than life itself.
  - Used his ministry as a front to perpetuate his real cause, to liberate his people.
- After Nat Turner's insurrection, the institution of slavery (In Virginia) became rigid.
  - Slaves were not allowed to be educated, or travel without permit.
  - They were not permitted to have religious gatherings with black preachers without white supervision.
- In the hands of black preachers, the bible taught equality.
- The Underground Railroad was a secret network used to help slaves escape and undermine the institution of slavery.
  - It had no leader, or elected official; it was self-organizing.
  - With the growing disparity of rights (Even in the north) many of the slaves traveling along the Underground Railroad continued on to Canada.
- With the expansion of the United States in the west, there was a major issue of whether or not they would take slavery with them.
  - A compromise was made that...
- 6 weeks after Abraham Lincoln became president, South Carolina seceded from the Union, and 4 months later the Civil War began.
  - Abraham Lincoln claimed that the war was to preserve the Union, rather than to end slavery.
  - Lincoln came out with the Emancipation Proclamation against the advice of much of his cabinet, and blacks were allowed to join the Union forces.
- "As slaves their goal was freedom, as free men and women their goal was equality."

Please voice on paper how these terms were used:
  Civil rights (lawyer): Represents a belief in progression forward (Integrationist).
  WCBS: White Citizens for Black Survival
  Racial realism: (pg. 98) 
    1. Historical perspective: There has been no linear progress in civil rights, a pattern of cyclical progression / regression.
    2. Economics: It is necessary to have less discussion of ethics and more discussion of economics (The real root of power / the problem).
      - This is how the professor is orienting this course (What position do blacks have in the economic system).
    3. Satisfaction through struggle: Calling out to a history of resistance, while they may get some rights back, there is still an issue of the continued struggle.
    4. The realization and acceptance that racism is an ongoing issue in the US, and that it doesn't disappear, it merely changes guises.
  Racial equality: 
  Racial injustice: 
  Constitution's framer: 
  Common laws: 
  Legal realist: (pg. 99/100) A group of legal scholars in the 1930s who believed that contemporary laws were based on an archaic system that no longer existed, and didn't account for social change.
  
Faces at the Bottom of the Well:
  - Takes place in the woods in Oregon.
  - Introduced with a professor that has gone into the woods to write.
  - Second character is Erica, a member of WCBS.
    - Concerned about a black holocaust, believes it may happen because racism still exists.
  - WCBS:
    - Doesn't allow black people into their organization.
    - Major proponent of racial realism.
  - There are two kinds of laws:
    1. Laws in the books.
    2. Laws that are actually integrated  / enforced (The practice of laws).
