14 - Black Power
  By: Stokely Carmichael - An activist who in the 60s pushed the ideology of Black Power, arguing that the integrationist approach was not sufficient for the problems of the African American.
  
  SNCC: Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee
  Black Power: Emphasizes racial pride and the creation of political and cultural institutions to protect the black communities' interests.
  
  Black Americans have two problems:
    1) They are poor.
    2) They are black.
  Example of black power: An Alabama law allows that a group of citizens can nominate candidates for county office and, upon winning 20% of the vote, be recognized as an independent political party. SNCC helped act upon this law in five counties, running under the black panther symbol.
  
  Believes that for racism to die, a totally different America must be born.
  Integration is founded on the idea that in order to have decent things (house, schools, etc.) a black must shift into a white lifestyle, implying that whiteness is inherently superior.
  It must be the oppressed that the SNCC speaks to first, not the friends of the oppressed.
  
  In conclusion the task of rebuilding this society, if possible, is the job of the white populace.

  The white people who desire changes in this country should go to where the problem is manifest, in the white communities where power has been creates for the express purpose of perpetuating their power.
  To proceed towards true liberation, the blacks must cut themselves off from the white people.
  SNCC should be totally self sufficient within the black community, as to not find itself entwined in the tentacles of white power.

  Black power means the effort to elect black citizens into office in proportion to their strength within the population.
  The irony of the Vietname war is that the black person is extorted towards nonviolence regarding social change while a bloody war is being fought in Southeast Asia.
  
  In summary SNCC is quite segregationist, and questions the necessity of even associating with the white populace at all.



15 - CORE Endorses Black Power
  By: Floyd McKissick - Another activist who became the first person to receive a LL.B. from North Carolina Law School, tried to create an all black planned community, but it never came to fruition.
  
  The rhetoric about power sharing (Land of the free, home of the brave, etc.) does not apply to black people, because it was written when they were still slaves.
  The black man must live with the daily fear of the white mans' potential - the aptitude to kill, punish and dominate...
  
  The unequivocal conclusion is that the right of revolution is one granted by the constitution itself, one that whites exercised in their oppression in 1776 and one that blacks have suffered through for too long. The black community must unite, and begin to make plans.



16 - To Atone for Our Sins and Errors in Vietnam
  By: Martin Luther King Jr. - Received the Nobel Peace Prize, was widely renowned for his anti-violence approach and became increasingly liberal towards the end of his life, particularly in opposing the Vietnam war.
  
  Feels it is necessary to speak out against the Vietnam war, and urges all others who agree with him to do the same.
  There will never be an investment of the necessary funds or energies in rehabilitation of America's poor so long as adventures like Vietnam continues to draw men and money.
  The black populace went to fight and die for the very freedoms that they were denied in their homeland.
  
  While many believed that King was a civil-rights leader, and had no role in the battlements of peace, he argued that the two are inexorably entwined - particularly in the instance of Vietnam.
  We destroyed the two most cherished institutions in Vietnam, the family and the village.
  
  In order to atone for out sins and errors in Vietnam, we should take the initiative in bringing a halt to this tragic war.
  We must continue to raise our voices if our nation insists in its perverse ways in Vietnam.

  The original vision of the party was to serve as a lifeline to the people.
  Revolution is a process, not a particular action or conclusion.
  The party attempts to build a political vehicle through which the people can express their revolutionary ideas.
  The correct way to handle a revolution is not an either-or approach, but by gaining the support of the people through serving their needs.
  Huey's goal was to move towards the building of a community structure which will become a true voice of the people, and promote their interests.
