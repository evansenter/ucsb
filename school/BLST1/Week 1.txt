  - The economic incentive is to produce a greater quantity of cash crops.
- Debter law: A law that makes it illegal to leave the county in which you owe debt. But because the jobs don't pay enough to provision supplies to work the jobs, you're caught in a Catch 22.

- To establish a long-lasting line of free labor, leverage a domesticated slave society.
  - These slaves are content with their lives because they know no different.
