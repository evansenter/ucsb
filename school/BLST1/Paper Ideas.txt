Christina,

So I've been doing some reading on the black church and wanted to focus my paper on the following topic: The impact of the western church as a proponent of nationalization in the black community. My postulation (And I haven't done enough primary / secondary research to confirm this) is that the indoctrination of the black community under the western (And specifically Christian) faith served as the primary catalyst towards the nationalistic views of the African-American subculture.

I'd like to hear your feedback on this idea, so that I can focus in on a clear and specific topic on this research paper.

Thanks,

Evan

Hi Evan,

This is a great paper topic. See in my studies, I would have thought that this type of faith in the black community was a catalyst for more traditional/constitutionalist  views of African American sub culture, but your paper may find something different! Look up what your sources say, because your point has to be backed up with sources in this particular paper.You should focus on a particular time period in order to make the paper 12 pages.
